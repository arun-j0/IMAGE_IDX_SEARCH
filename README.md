# Image Similarity Project

This project demonstrates image similarity using CLIP model embeddings and Pinecone for storage and retrieval.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run streamlit_app/upload_image.py`

## Structure

- `app/`: Contains backend logic for embeddings and similarity calculations.
- `streamlit_app/`: Contains Streamlit app components.
- `images/`: Directory where uploaded images are stored.
